### Checklist for your GitHub portfolio



**Due dates:**

To keep up with class, and for sharing with fellow classmates, these are often due before class but generally at least by the end of the week. There is no penalty for late assignments but you'll need to submit your complete portfolio of work by the end of the semester.



**Grading criteria:**

Your grade for the course is based on **completion** of required elements (everything marked as **push to GitHub** in homework). 

Below is a running checklist of all the homework marked as **push to GitHub** that you need to complete and upload to GitHub. Please make it easy for me to find these, preferably by naming your script files by week or organizing them into weekly folders, and collecting all the individual project files together.
