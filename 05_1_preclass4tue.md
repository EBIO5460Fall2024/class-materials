### Week 5: Preclass preparation for Tuesday

Make sure you're caught up on any previous work and you've pushed all your work to GitHub!



#### 1. Feedback for me

Let me know how the class is going for you so far. I want to check in about homework and how the flipped format is working. Please fill out the qualtrics survey here:

#### 2. Skill of the week: how to try out new code with Git

When you have an alternative way to do something in code, say for example, a different version of an algorithm, or a different algorithm for the same problem, you can try it out by creating a new branch in your repository. Branches are for coding experiments. If your experiment works out you can merge it back in to the main branch.

#### 3. Video lecture: frequentist inference algorithms in lm()

   * [05_2_slides_lm_inference_algos.pdf](05_2_slides_lm_inference_algos.pdf)
   * [05_2_video_lm_inference_algos.md](05_2_video_lm_inference_algos.md) - 11 mins



#### 4. Confidence and prediction intervals

Using `lm()` with your dataset, make and plot prediction intervals for `y|x` (i.e. the intervals around the fitted mean line).  **Push your code to GitHub.**



#### 5. Reading on the bootstrap algorithm
