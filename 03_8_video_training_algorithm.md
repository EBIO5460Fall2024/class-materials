### Video mini lecture

[Introduction to training algorithms](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x6z4o7txe0juqdj/03_vid3_training_algo.mp4?dl=0) (17 mins)

* Least squares: minimize distance of model from data
* Developing a grid search algorithm
* Phases of an algorithm
* Pseudocode
* Top down refinement

You can ignore the 30 secs at the beginning that mentions reading on the design matrix (I didn't want you to read it yet)
