### Reading to support Week 6 Tue

All reading can be found in the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b6zM2d5sgrXF4ttY01hBKu5KDYkA9vsV?usp=sharing) (papers are in "Other reading", relevant sections of McElreath are in "Texts").



#### Further reading on *p*-values
We'll touch on issues with *p*-values throughout the course but won't dedicate further time to it. I urge you to read this small selection of papers and others for self education.

   * The ASA statement on *p*-values is essential reading for any scientist:

   * Lew gives a useful perspective on how scientists use and abuse *p*-values, contrasting Fisher's approach with the null hypothesis significance test (NHST) of Neyman-Pearson:
   * http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1476-5381.2012.01931.x
   * Greenland et al give an extensive list of misinterpretations of *p*-values and confidence intervals

#### Likelihood: counting using the garden of forking paths

Page references are to McElreath (2016) first edition.

   * McElreath Chapter 1, The Golem of Prague, section 1.1 only (pp 1-3)
     * 	McElreath's Golem is our "algorithms"

#### Likelihood inference algorithm for the linear model

   * Read the following and explore the R code. This is what we'll cover in lectures this week.
   * Additional R files associated with this script are in the `source` directory.
