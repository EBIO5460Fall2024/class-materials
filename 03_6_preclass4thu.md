### Week 3: Preclass homework for Thursday



#### 1. Video lecture: 3 classes of algorithms

We've now started writing and using algorithms in data science. This is an overview.

#### 2. Video lecture: Introduction to training algorithms

Training algorithms are central to all of data science.  In class you'll translate the pseudocode for the grid search algorithm to R code and use it on a dataset.

#### 3. Find a dataset for simple linear regression

We'll be doing various things with a basic dataset for simple linear regression, just one dependent and one independent variable, both continuous. This could be from an analysis you've done before, either as part of your research, or in a previous statistics class. Or you could just bring a favorite dataset. The main criterion is that the relationship should be obviously fairly linear.
