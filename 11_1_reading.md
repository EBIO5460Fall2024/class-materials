### Reading to support Week 11

All reading can be found in the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b6zM2d5sgrXF4ttY01hBKu5KDYkA9vsV?usp=sharing) (papers are in "Other reading", relevant sections of McElreath are in "Texts").



#### 1. Poisson distribution

Read the short section on the Poisson distribution, from Chapter 4 of Ben Bolker's book. The section called *Bestiary of distributions* is a handy reference going forward.



#### 2. Reading for multilevel models (Ch 12 Gelman & Hill)

Sections up to and including 12.4 (pp 251-262). The main concepts are:

* Notation

* Partial pooling (shrinkage) versus no pooling versus complete pooling

* Using `lmer()` from the lme4 package
