### Reading to support Week 9

All reading can be found in the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b6zM2d5sgrXF4ttY01hBKu5KDYkA9vsV?usp=sharing) (papers are in "Other reading", relevant sections of McElreath are in "Texts").



#### McElreath Ch 9: Introduction to generalized linear models

The models we have encountered so far are a special case of generalized linear models (GLMs). We are going to extend now to the general case of a GLM: a linearly-transformed model with a range of possible distributions for the data. This is within the assumed prerequisite for this class, so hopefully some of this is revision, reinforcement, or another perspective for most of you.

* Read section 9.2, pp 280 - 288.

* Skip 9.2.4. The information here is incorrect: you can indeed compare models with different likelihoods via AIC, although you need to be careful to do it right.

* **Optionally**, the perspective on maximum entropy in section 9.1 is quite interesting and somewhat unique (this perspective is heavily influenced by Jaynes 2003 Probability Theory) but you don't need to understand this. If this is your first time encountering GLMs, skip it: it's more likely to be overload than helpful the first time through this topic.
