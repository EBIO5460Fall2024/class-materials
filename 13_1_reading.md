### Reading to support Week 13

All reading can be found in the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b6zM2d5sgrXF4ttY01hBKu5KDYkA9vsV?usp=sharing) (papers are in "Other reading", relevant sections of McElreath and Gelman & Hill are in "Texts").



#### 1. Binomial distribution and others

Further reading on the binomial distribution is the short section from Chapter 4 of Ben Bolker's book. The section called *Bestiary of distributions* is a handy reference. If you haven't already read it from the earlier homework, it is worth reading through the whole of *Bestiary of distributions* to get a sense of what distributions might be relevant to your individual project.
