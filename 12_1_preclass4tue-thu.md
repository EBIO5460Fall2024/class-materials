### Week 12: Preclass preparation for Tue-Thu

R markdown,  individual proposals, multilevel models. Aim to look at the EDA code and become familiar with the radon example from the reading by Tue. Everything else by Thursday. You'll discuss your individual project proposal with me on Thursday.



#### 1. Skill of the week: R markdown

* [repsci04_rmarkdown.md](skills_tutorials/repsci04_rmarkdown.md)



#### 2. Radon multilevel EDA - R code

This is the data in Gelman & Hill Ch 12. Take a look at the R code in the class repo:

* [12_3_radon_multilevel_EDA](12_3_radon_multilevel_EDA.md). Exploratory data analysis using `dplyr()` and `ggplot()`



#### 3. Reading: multilevel models

Also see the reading for this week, which is the radon example. We'll do writing the model on Tuesday.



#### 4. Study design

It's crucial to consider study design in your individual project. I have posted reading to the  [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b6zM2d5sgrXF4ttY01hBKu5KDYkA9vsV?usp=sharing) (Texts):

* Quinn & Keough Ch 7 Design and Power Analysis
  * There are better ways to assess the quality of a design than classical power analysis, so I have only included material on design (not power analysis)
  * Sections on replication, controls, and randomization are especially relevant
  * Keep your individual project in mind when reading this chapter




#### 5. Individual project proposal

Read the guidelines for the individual project:

* [00_individual_project.md](00_individual_project.md)

Review these guidelines now and please ask me for any clarifications etc. We haven't covered everything mentioned here yet but we will.

Next, expand and finalize your proposal. I will first review your bullet points from last week. Wait until I get back to you about that (by Monday). Then, you should expand your bullet points with a bit more detail to turn in a brief final project proposal (about half a page).

When describing your study and data, consider these critical design considerations:

* replication
* randomization
* controls

Save as a markdown or text file to your repo and **push to GitHub by Thursday before class** so we can discuss it together in our 1:1 meeting on Thursday.
